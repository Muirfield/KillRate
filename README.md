**DO NOT POST QUESTION/BUG-REPORTS/REQUESTS IN THE REVIEWS**

It is difficult to carry a conversation in the reviews.  If you
have a question/bug-report/request please use the
[Thread](http://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/killrate.8060/) for
that.  You are more likely to get a response and help that way.

_NOTE:_

This documentation was last updated for version **2.0.1**.

Please go to
[github](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/tree/master/KillRate)
for the most up-to-date documentation.

You can also download this plugin from this [page](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/releases/tag/KillRate-2.0.1).

<!-- end-include -->

This plugin keeps track on how much killing is going-on on a server.

It may optionally use an economy plugin like for example, PocketMoney,
to reward killing.

Basic Usage:

* killrate - Will show your KillRate stats.
* killrate stats [player] - Show the KillRate stats for [player]
* killrate top [online] - Show top players.

You can also place signs to show game statistics.

## Documentation

This plugin supports PocketMoney, GoldStd, MassiveEconomy and EconomysAPI.

### Signs

You can place signs showing current game statistics.  The following
sign types are available by default, by entering the keyword
([KEYWORD]) in **LINE1** of the sign:

* [STATS] - Current player statistics
* [RANKINGS] - Top 3 players + scores
* [ONLINE TOPS] - Top 3 on-line players + scores
* [RANKNAMES] - Top 3 player names
* [RANKPOINTS] - Top 3 player scores
* [TOPNAMES] - Top 3 on-line player names
* [TOPPOINTS] - Top 3 on-line player scores

Signs showing top players can be further customized by adding
additional entries in the sign text:

* LINE2 - Title, this will be the first line of the sign.  If,
  however, you set it to **"^^^"** (Three consecutive **^** signs),
  the title will be omitted (and the sign will show a top 4).
* LINE3 - What statistic to count.  It defaults to _points_, but it
  can be changed to anything (for example, _deaths_, _player_, etc).
  Essentially the value here is the word on the left when you enter
  the command _killrate stats_.
* LINE4 - format line, select a format out of the **config.yml**
  file's **formats** section.

In the **formats** section you have:

```
  selector: format
```

The **selector** is a word that matches the text in **LINE4** of the
sign.  The format can contain any text and the following variable
substitutions:

* {player} - player's name
* {n} - rank number
* {count} - score
* {sname} - only the first 8 characters of the player's name

## Translations

This plugin will honour the server language configuration.  The
languages currently available are:

* English
* Spanish


You can provide your own message file by creating a file called
**messages.ini** in the plugin config directory.
Check [github](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/tree/master/KillRate/resources/messages/)
for sample files.
Alternatively, if you have
[GrabBag](http://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins/grabbag.1060/) v2.3
installed, you can create an empty **messages.ini** using the command:

     pm dumpmsgs KillRate [lang]

<!-- end-include -->

## API

This plugins implements an API.  Please go to
[API docs](http://alejandroliu.github.io/pocketmine-plugins/apidocs/index.html)
to read the API reference documentation.

Example Usage:

### Check API availability

```php
$api = null;
if (($plugin = $server->getPluginManager()->getPlugin("KillRate") !== null) &&
      $plugin->isEnabled() &&
      MPMU::apiCheck($plugin->getDescription()->getVersion(),"2.0")) {
  $api = $plugin->api;
}
```

### Call an API function:

```php
$score = $api->getScore($player);
```

## KillRateEx

There is a script extension for KillRate that implements Levels in KillRate
called KillRateEx.

It is not as plug and play as KillRate so it is only available as a script
plugin.  This is because it requires to be customized before use.

KillRateEx can be downloaded from
[github](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/tree/master/KillRate)

Some versions of KillRate will create a sample KillRateEx.php in the KillRate
folder.  You then only need to copy that file to your Plugins folder.  That
version may be out-of-date, so preferably you should download it from the link
shown earlier.

In order to use the script extension you need to do the following:

1. Download the script plugin:
   [KillRateEx.php](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/tree/master/KillRate/examples)
2. Copy the script plugin to your plugin folder.
3. Install [PurePerms](http://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins/pureperms.862/)
4. Read KillRateEx.php on how to configure PurePerms or alternatively download
   and use the example [PurePerms-groups.yml](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/tree/master/KillRate/examples)
   and place it in the PurePerms folder as "groups.yml".
5. Read and modify KillRateEx.php according to taste.  The script has plenty
   of comments on how things work.
6. Re-start your server.

## TODO

* getSysVarsV1 : should cache values.
  - death-dealer should expire cache.
  - getSysVars when called will check cache and return.
  - if cache is expire, we calculate.
  - Alternatively, getRankings should do the caching....

## FAQ

* Q: Can you score when you push people to lava (or other indirect kills)?
* A: Only direct kills are scored.  All indirect kills (pushing people
  to lava, causing explosions, etc) can not be scored.
