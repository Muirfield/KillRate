Overview
--------

Keep track on how much killing is going-on on a server.

It may optionally use an economy plugin like for example, PocketMoney,
to reward killing.

Basic Usage:

* killrate - Will show your KillRate stats.
* killrate stats [player] - Show the KillRate stats for [player]
* killrate top [online] - Show top players.

Documentation
-------------

This plugin supports PocketMoney and GoldStd and has experimental
support for MassiveEconomy and EconomyAPI.

### Configuration

These can be configured from `config.yml`:

    settings:
	points: true
	rewards: true
	creative: false
    values:
	zombie: [10,100]
	Player: [100, 100]
	'*': [0, -10]

If `creative` is set to true, kills done when the player is in
`creative` will be counted.  The default is false, *NOT* to count
them.

If `points` is true, points are awarded and tracked.  You need to
enable `points` for the rankings to work.

If `rewards` is true, money is awarded.  You need an economy plugin
for this to work.

`values` are used to configure how many points or how much money is
awarded per kill type.  The first number is points, the second is
money.  You can use negative values.
